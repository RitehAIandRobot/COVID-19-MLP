# COVID-19 MLP

The repository contains code for modeling the COVID-19 spread, using location and time data, by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The repository is split into four directories:

## Input Data

[Data as used for training, obtained from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

In here, data used for training, is provided for simplicity.

## Modeling

Code used for modeling. Written in Python, and requires the following libraries:

* SKLearn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* UUID

## Models

Pickled Models achieved. For example of use see "Plots" directory.

## Plots

Code used for plotting, alongside the generated plots.
